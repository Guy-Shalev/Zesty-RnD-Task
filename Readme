General comments

The instructions and code were provided for Python, since I'm working with Java I spend some time converting the requirements to Java. This took me some time from completing the task, 
Therefore, I had to assume the connection to AWS and the docker were like a 'black box' and that it worked as intended.

Given more time, I would have separated the file reading and writing code to a separated class to handle it, so it can be reused in both functions.
Also, I would add unit testing.

Do to time constrains and converting the docker access to Java, this part was left unfinished. However, what I would have done is to call the file (and return a log error if not found),
convert it to an object and get the list of instances for the given region.
